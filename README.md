At [kittie.club](https://www.instagram.com/kittie.club), we often need to nebulize some of our sick cats. This usually involves placing the patient inside a carrier with a portable nebulizer to help them breathe more easily.

To streamline the process, I designed this simple mount to quickly and securely attach a portable nebulizer to a cat carrier.

This is designed for a portable nebulizer with an outer diameter of 20mm and a cat carrier with 25mm spacing.
